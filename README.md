## Project: indian_diet
#### Overview:
###### - Global diet shift is occurring in mid-income countries amongst the middle to upper class. 
###### - India provides a unique case study due to population increases, and relative low amounts of meat diet shifts compared to comparable GDP countries.

#### Goals:
###### - Examine at India's diet shift, the drivers and emission outcomes of this shift.
###### - Map change of meat consumption in urban India
###### - Map drivers of change (e.g, rural, urban, gdp, etc.)
###### - Map outcomes of change (e.g., net emissions)



#### To do's:
###### Vinny
  - [ ] Look for production of each animal source to amount of Kg (e.g., how many kg of meat does 1 cow produce?) 

###### Poushali
  - [ ] Convert kg to cal for each food item 
  - [ ] Send Vinny the cleaned up dataset and R code (or post to GitHub) 

###### Unassigned (Check off as completed):
  - [ ] Calculate total calories
  - [ ] Calculate percentage calories from different protein sources (e.g., meat, fish, eggs, milk, pulses, etc.)
  - [ ] Calculate percentage calories from different fat sources if possible. How do we determine amount of fat per source? 
  - [ ] Visualize changes in food basket over time: what are the changes in percentage of calories from different protein sources over time? What are the changes in percentage of calories from different fat sources over time?
